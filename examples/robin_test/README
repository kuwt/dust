More complex case  employing a number of different features, from restart to 
vortex particle method and fast multipole.

To execute copy or link the executables, and then 

./dust
./dust_post

The simulation is restarted from a previous result loading the previous 
geometry and advanced in time. For this reason it should not be necessary to 
run the preprocessor. The input files for the preprocessor and the needed 
items to create the mesh are however present.

Finally visualizations and loads are computed
