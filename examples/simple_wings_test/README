Simple case to demonstrate the basic functionalities of DUST.

To run the case copy or link the executables in this folder, then run

./dust_pre

to generate the geometry, then

./dust

to execute the computations and finally

./dust_post

to generate the visualizations of the results.

The results will be stored in the folder Output, while the postprocessed results
in vtk format are stored in the Postprocessing folder.

To obtain the results in tecplot format, edit the dust_post.in file and 
substitute

Format = vtk

with 

Format = tecplot
