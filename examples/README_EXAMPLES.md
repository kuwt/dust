In this folder are grouped some examples to show some of the capabilities of dust.

It is not meant to be an exaustive review of all the features of dust.


## DUST simulations examples

- simple_wings
- flapping_wing
- robin 
- flapped_wing

To run the examples, run in sequence:
- dust_pre
- dust
- dust_post

In case you haven't proceeded with the 'make install', copy or link the executables
into the single examples folders, then run in sequence :
- ./dust_pre
- ./dust
- ./dust_post

## DUST-MBDyn simulations examples 
- goland_wing
- coupled_wings

To run the coupled examples, run:
- ./run.sh

The run file executes the main python script located inside the structure folder. Make sure you have added adapter folder to your Python path.
